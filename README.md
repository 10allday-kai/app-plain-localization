## Sample app of localizing KaiOS app content using l10n library
## Why you need to localize your app?

KaiOS aims to close the digital divide and provide relevant content to its users. Many of whom are in emerging markets and may be non-English speakers.

Having local content and games & other apps available in the local languages would hugely benefit the users. It also benefits the developers as their content would have higher visibility, reach, and retention rate as you are serving content that is more appealing to the users.

KaiOS supports 80+ languages globally, and in this sample app, we have used English as default language and added support for Urdu, Swahili, Spanish, French and Russian language.
